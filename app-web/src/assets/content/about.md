## Who watches the watchmen?

Blue in View is a collection of video recordings of our police made by you - the people - and categorized by location and by officer name. It's a public record of the behavior of our police officers and acts as a balance to the power dynamic between law enforcement and citizens.

This project is not built on an anti-police mindset, but rather on the belief that order and stability come from checks and balances. The system allows the police to act as a check on us, and Blue in View allows us to act as a check on the police.
